# Random Password Generator 1.0

This is one of the first applications through which I started learning the C language. I created it in Turbo C v3.0 back in 2002. Now I’ve committed it to GitHub so it’s available to others as well.

To enable mouse functionality, uncheck the "Quick Edit Mode" and "Insert Mode" options in the window settings.

For a larger window, set the font to 10x18 in the settings.
